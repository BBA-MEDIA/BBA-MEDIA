The SimpleGig software I have been working on has been written to support musicians who use backing tracks in their performances. 
I couildn't find an existing simple 'cart' playout system, and not one that gave me the infomration I needed at playout like set
time, elapsed time and remaining time. The system uses a simple drag and drop MP3 file system in four banks of twenty files. There
is shuffle left, right and delete functionality as well as STOP and FADE on the current playout track. The system is deliberately
devoid of 'settings' so it remains as simple as possible.
